This study investigated the effects of iTBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at different stimulation intensities on brain entropy (BEN). The findings revealed that subthreshold (90% rMT) iTBS reduced striatal BEN, while suprathreshold  (120% rMT) iTBS increased striatal BEN. Furthermore, subthreshold iTBS altered the baseline correlation between BEN and neurotransmitter receptor/transporter maps. These results suggest that subthreshold iTBS may be a more beneficial stimulation approach, whereas suprathreshold iTBS could potentially induce transient adverse effects.

This study is part of our series investigating noninvasive brain stimulation (NBS). As early as 2017, we employed resting-state BEN to examine the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left DLPFC in healthy young adults [1,2]. Our findings revealed reduced BEN in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC), key regions implicated in emotional regulation. This discovery suggests a potential mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC, namely through top-down modulation of temporal coherence between the left DLPFC and MOFC/sgACC, thereby enhancing emotional regulation.

Furthermore, our recent study using publicly available datasets from another laboratory demonstrated increased resting-state BEN in the MOFC/sgACC following low-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC. This work is currently undergoing peer review, and a preprint version has been published on bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.16.601109)[3].

These consistent findings across different stimulation protocols underscore the robustness of BEN as a tool for detecting neural plasticity. Notably, BEN demonstrates sensitivity to various rTMS protocols and maintains its reliability across different laboratories, experimental environments, and fMRI scanning parameters.

This body of work collectively highlights the potential of BEN as a robust biomarker for assessing neuroplastic changes induced by different rTMS protocols while demonstrating remarkable consistency across diverse experimental settings
