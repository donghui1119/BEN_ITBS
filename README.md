# Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)-induced changes of resting-state brain entropy (BEN)


We made the files of this project publicly available on OSF. However, without any apparent reason, when I attempted to edit the project description in detail, my account was suspended. I received an email stating that "your account on the Open Science Framework has been flagged as spam and disabled." I am currently in contact with OSF support to resolve this issue. If the problem is not resolved satisfactorily, I plan to discontinue using this platform and will migrate all relevant materials to GitHub.
