## Finds

This study investigated the effects of iTBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at different stimulation intensities on brain entropy (BEN). The findings revealed that subthreshold (90% rMT) iTBS reduced striatal BEN, while suprathreshold  (120% rMT) iTBS increased striatal BEN. Furthermore, subthreshold iTBS altered the baseline correlation between BEN and neurotransmitter receptor/transporter maps. These results suggest that subthreshold iTBS may be a more beneficial stimulation approach, whereas suprathreshold iTBS could potentially induce transient adverse effects.

This study is part of our series investigating noninvasive brain stimulation (NBS). As early as 2017, we employed resting-state BEN to examine the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left DLPFC in healthy young adults (Song, Chang et al. 2017, Song, Chang et al. 2019). Our findings revealed reduced BEN in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC), key regions implicated in emotional regulation. This discovery suggests a potential mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC, namely through top-down modulation of temporal coherence between the left DLPFC and MOFC/sgACC, thereby enhancing emotional regulation.

Furthermore, our recent study using publicly available datasets from OpenNeuro ds001927 (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001927/versions/2.1.0)  (Castrillon et al. 2025) demonstrated increased resting-state BEN in the MOFC/sgACC following low-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC (Song, Deng et al. 2025). This work is currently published in Cerebral Cortex.

Notably, a 10-day course of HF-rTMS targeting the left DLPFC in chronic smokers was found to induce significant reductions in striatal BEN (Chang, Zhang et al. 2018).

These consistent findings across different stimulation protocols underscore the robustness of BEN as a tool for detecting neural plasticity. Notably, BEN demonstrates sensitivity to various rTMS protocols and maintains its reliability across different laboratories, experimental environments, and fMRI scanning parameters.

This body of work collectively highlights the potential of BEN as a robust biomarker for assessing neuroplastic changes induced by different rTMS protocols while demonstrating remarkable consistency across diverse experimental settings
