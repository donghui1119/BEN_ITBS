This study investigated the effects of iTBS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) at different stimulation intensities on brain entropy (BEN). The findings revealed that subthreshold (90% rMT) iTBS reduced striatal BEN, while suprathreshold  (120% rMT) iTBS increased striatal BEN. Furthermore, subthreshold iTBS altered the baseline correlation between BEN and neurotransmitter receptor/transporter maps. These results suggest that subthreshold iTBS may be a more beneficial stimulation approach, whereas suprathreshold iTBS could potentially induce transient adverse effects.
